# Bank-Account-Simulation-By-Java
Bank Account Simulation is a classic project to practice Java OOP concepts! Hereâ€™s a simple but solid implementation outline

This project simulates a simple bank account system using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows creating an account, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and viewing the transaction history.

âœ… Features
Account creation with initial balance

Deposit and withdrawal methods with input validation

Transaction history recording every operation

Balance maintenance with clear, informative statements

ðŸ“‚ Files
BankSimulation.java â€“ Main Java file containing the Account class and the entry point to run the simulation.


ðŸ’¡ Concepts Demonstrated
Classes and Objects (Account class encapsulating bank operations)

Data Encapsulation (private fields with public methods)

Collections (ArrayList for transaction history)

Input validation for realistic banking operations

Simple logging of transactions
